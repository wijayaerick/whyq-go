## Why I wrote this
I want to have quick access to my office lunch orders. 
I use my second monitor to display my [terminal dashboard](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf), 
so I can just take a quick look to it. 

> But I can just visit the site, login, and view my orders?

The site's login session expires quickly, so I need to do this every time I want to see my order.
Guess I'm just too lazy ðŸ¤·.
